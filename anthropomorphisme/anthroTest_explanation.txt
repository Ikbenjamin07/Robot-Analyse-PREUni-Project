Explanation of the Code:
Preprocess Image: preprocess_image() loads the image, converts it to grayscale, 
    and applies binary thresholding to separate the object from the background.

Get Contours: get_contours() finds the contours of objects in the image.

Symmetry Score: symmetry_score() checks both vertical and horizontal symmetry by flipping 
    the image along both axes and calculating the pixel-wise similarity.

Aspect Ratio Score: aspect_ratio_score() calculates the aspect ratio of the objectâ€™s 
    bounding rectangle and scores it based on how close it is to an assumed human aspect ratio.

Human-Likeness Score: human_likeness_score() combines the symmetry and aspect ratio scores for 
    a final score indicating "human-likeness."
